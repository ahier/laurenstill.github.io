I've been reaching out to HIMSS for the past 6 months trying to find out a few things, but have been met with radio silence. In the past 2-3 years, HIMSS national convention has had police involvement for harassment and assault cases several times ( > 6x ) and I don't think it's unreasonable to make contact and mitigation information accessible to members and attendees. Jan 28, 2014 I submitted an open letter to HIMSS Media, but it was rejected unless I was willing to remove any mention of the organization. As such, my open plea has been largely ignored, and unanswered.

Specifically, I am seeking the following information:

1) HIMSS Conference Code of Conduct, and anti- harassment policies and procedures.

2) Public points of contact to report harassment and assault complaints both at member events and at the national conference.

3) Formal response to my many requests to make this information publicly visible and accessible.

Furthermore, I'm trying to obtain some speaker demographic data from the HIMSS14 conference. It would be great if I had data for the past ten years, but I'm not very hopeful. I'm curious, for an organization which lobbies for data interoperability, why is this only available through manual pdf scanning? Do I really need to scan a 100+ page schedule to access this information?  Specfically, I'd love the following speaker information:

4) Hometown (or home state/country) of speakers

5) Gender or identified gender

6) Age or age range. Over/under 30yrs would suffice

7) Company Role

I'll keep trying, and will update this page with any responses. Maybe 2015 will show some progress. Sigh.
