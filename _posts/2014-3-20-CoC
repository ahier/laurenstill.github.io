*<a href="http://www.laurencstill.com/himssplzrespond.html">And open letter to HIMSS</a>*


Still trying to get any response from <a href="http://www.himss.org">HIMSS</a> regarding their code of conduct and procedures and contact information for reporting sexual harrassment and assualt situations. Something, anything. 

So, short post.  Still counting....
