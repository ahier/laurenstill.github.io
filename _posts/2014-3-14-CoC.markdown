*<a href="http://www.laurencstill.com/himssplzrespond.html">An Open Letter to HIMSS</a>*


Still trying to get any response from <a href="http://www.himss.org">HIMSS</a> regarding their code of conduct, procedures, protocol, and contact information for reporting sexual harassment and assault situations at conferences and sanctioned community events. Something, anything. 

I have emailed all the publicly available contacts several times over the past few months, without a reply. I have canvassed the member's forums and listservs. I've even submitted articles and op-eds within <a href="http://www.himssmedia.com/">HIMSS Media</a> outlining the problem and reached out on social media.  I find it disturbing that a conference with <a href="http://www.himssconference.org/">40k attendees from all over the world</a> has been so unresponsive to inquiries on how to report misconduct and assault. 

So, short post. I'll expand later when I have support, or a reply. Still counting....

Update: March 18th I <a href="http://www.laurencstill.com/media/himssCoCemail.png">recieved a reply from Joyce Lofstrom</a>, Senior Director of Communications at HIMSS, letting me know that their legal counsel would be in touch, sometime after she returns to the office on March 28th.

Update: April 2  This is getting long.  Spoke with <a href="mailto:rorenick@himss.org">Racquel Orenick</a>, HIMSS legal counsel, who was only able to confirm that any reports of misconduct, harassment or assault should be directed to one of a dozen different emails publicly listed. Of those mentioned, himss@himss.org was named first (coincidentally, my first attempt as well) and herself, last. If those attempts are unsuccessful, reach out to anyone on the Executive board, listed <a href="http://www.himss.org/executive-contacts?navItemNumber=18016">here</a>.  While HIMSS has many different codes of conduct, conference attendees are <a href="http://www.himssconference.org/Registration/Content.aspx?ItemNumber=22970">only expected to abide by the terms and conditions of their registration</a>, which does not include any behavior clauses.  Unfortunately, unless something has already personally happened and a complaint is being filed, HIMSS is unable to share their internal CoC.  

What's perhaps even more unsettling is the refusal to disclose information that is being asked on a personal level due to their belief that I am "press" and therefore must submit all enquires through HIMSS PR.  I have been talking back and forth with HIMSS PR for the past month, and they sent to to legal. I am not paid to write, and I have no contract with any media outlet.  I tweet a lot and spend too much time online, but this was a personal request.  The sad truth is, this website is the only way I managed to get any response from HIMSS, and now they are using it as the basis to avoid answering any questions regarding the personal safety of 40k people. The irony?  I was explicitly <a href=" http://www.laurencstill.com/media/himss_press_2013.png">denied press credentials a year ago</a> by Joyce Lofstrom, when I was writing regularly.  

That's not right.
