*<a href="http://www.laurencstill.com/himssplzrespond.html">An Open Letter to HIMSS</a>*


Still trying to get any response from <a href="http://www.himss.org">HIMSS</a> regarding their code of conduct, procedures, protocol, and contact information for reporting sexual harrassment and assualt situations at conferences and sanctioned community events. Something, anything. 

So, short post. I'll expand later when I have community support. Still counting....
