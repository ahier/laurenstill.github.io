*<a href="http://www.laurencstill.com/himssplzrespond.html">An Open Letter to HIMSS</a>*


Still trying to get any response from <a href="http://www.himss.org">HIMSS</a> regarding their code of conduct, procedures, protocol, and contact information for reporting sexual harassment and assault situations at conferences and sanctioned community events. Something, anything. 

I have emailed all the publicly available contacts several times over the past few months, without a reply, even with 'media/press' status. I have canvased the member's forums and listserves. I've even tried to publish articles within <a href="http://www.himssmedia.com/">HIMSS Media</a> outlining the problem.  I find it disturbing that a conference with <a href="http://www.himssconference.org/">40k attendees from all over the world</a> has been so unresponsive to inquiries on how to report an assault. 

So, short post. I'll expand later when I have community support. Still counting....
