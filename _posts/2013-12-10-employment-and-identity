Money.  So much of our self worth is tied to little numbers on a page and job titles on a business card.

I got my start in healthcare many years ago, working an entry level job doing medical billing and coding for $15/hr. I worked my butt off at the role, being the best damn biller and coder I could be, but there were no raises, no bonuses and it didn’t take long for me to internalize the position as part of my identity.  

Eventually, due to a geographical change, I had to seek out new employment.  My next position paid $75k, had benefits, challenging responsibilities, the whole deal.  All the attributes of a “real job” according to my mom. 

So what did I do to bring about such a drastic change in compensation, and quality of life?  I didn’t just graduate, there was no new certification, no nepotism, no added job skill that I didn’t already posses at my previous role.

It’s really more about what I didn’t do.
  - I didn’t move on when it was clear I had outgrown the role.
  - I didn’t fight for promotions, bonuses, benefits, responsibility.
  - I didn’t fight against my own fear and self doubt, insecurity.
  - I didn’t address my underemployment, and under utilization with my employer.

Instead, I let that position define who I was, and what I was capable of, and I stayed there paralyzed in fear of the unknown for far too long.  Looking back, it’s a scary place to be, mentally.  

Today, I’m more cognizant of that voice inside, and I make an active effort to do the opposite.  I write.  I speak.  I try things I know I’m not good at and I push myself outside of my comfort level.  I make my voice heard, and I help others to find theirs. 

I have a new fear that’s driving my actions these days, fear of settling.
