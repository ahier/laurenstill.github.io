Six months ago I came across [Jennifer Dewalt's][1] post on [HN][2] and made a plegde that I would try something similar in the near future.  The sites/pages/projects are simple and often focus on my problem areas (um, hello front-end dev) and I believe it will be a project I can commit to.  

I probably wont do one a day, but am realistically aiming for 3-4 per week.  I'll list all the pages here, and update as I can.  AS for other New Year resolutions, I'm hoping to present at conferences more, and write professionally on a somewhat regular basis.  Generally, put myself out there more.

On a personal level, I'm focusing on empathy.  I didn't see nearly enough in the community in 2013.  

Happy 2014!
