Six months ago I came across [Jennifer Dewalt's][1] post on [HN][2] and made a plegde that I would try something similar in the near future.  The sites/pages/projects are simple and often focus on my problem areas (um, hello JS) and I believe it will be different enough from work to stay kinda fun.  That's the point, right?

I probably wont do one/day, but I am realistically aiming for 3-4 per week.  I'll list all the pages here, and update as I go.  As for other New Year resolutions, I'm hoping to present at conferences more, and write professionally on a somewhat regular basis (healthcaare IT, security, mobile health, etc).  Generally, put myself out there, in the community, in front of real live people who may not always say nice things.  It'll be ok.  

On a personal level, I'm focusing on empathy.  I didn't see nearly enough in the community in 2013.  

And yes, this blog counts as site numero uno.  Happy 2014!
